<br/>
I am a researcher and assistant professor at the Institute of Financial Complex Systems at Masaryk University in Brno, Czech Republic. My specializations are financial markets and data sciences. Currently, I am teaching several courses related to financial derivatives and corporate finance.

As a researcher, I am skilled in python, which allows me to apply statistical and machine learning methods to a variety of research questions in finance. My research interests are diverse, but my recent works revolve around volatility modeling and forecasting in the financial markets. I also like, for example, probabilistic programming and bayesian methods or quantitative trading.

I like to learn new things, so even though I'm a busy person, I am open to collaboration in any issue which involves my coding and data science skills.
